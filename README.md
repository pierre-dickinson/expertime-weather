 === Do not use in production (for testing purpose only) ===
 This Wordpress plugin displays weather of the day regarding position or address sent by the user. It also displays the forecast for the next coming days on a dedicated page 'my-weather'.
 You need to add your own Google Maps API key in the wordpress admin plugin settings section to enable the Google search adress autosuggest component.
